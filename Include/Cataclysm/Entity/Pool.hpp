/* For now, Entity_pool does NOT include a map which uses location as a key.
 * Originally I thought this would speed up Game::entity_at(int x, int y), but
 * in order for this map to be useful, we'd have to update it every turn, which
 * means it'd probably be more trouble than it's worth, except when the map is
 * being called several times per turn.  We'd also have to update it after
 * every monster moves, which is a lot.
 * This means that monster_at() has to iterate over all monsters, which is
 * potentially slow, but what can you do.

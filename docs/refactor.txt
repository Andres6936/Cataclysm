Items to refactor:

Attacks / damage:
  Lots of classes hold "int damage[DAMAGE_MAX]" or "int armor[DAMAGE_MAX]"
  We have a class called "Damage_set," this should replace all of those arrays.
  Might want to program some artihmetic for Damage_set.

Map drawing:
  FoV code could probably be better.
  Tell Map to handle drawing of the PC's glyph.
  Add sight distance limit.

Worldmap generation:
  It's a big, messy function.  Would be nice to clean it up a bunch.

Damage loading
  Fields and melee attacks have a sloppy bit at the end of load_data() where we
  check if the ident is also the name of a damage type.  Clean this up and make
  a Damage_set::load_data() function!

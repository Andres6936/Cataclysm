On each turn we need to:
  1) Set a goal
    For most monsters this is going to be "attack player."
    It might also be "attack any entity."
    Other goals may be "search area," "investigate sound" or "get/eat item."
  2) Decide how to achieve that goal
    2a) Attack Entity
      2ai)    Melee entity
      2aii)   Ranged attack
      2aiii)  Path towards entity
        This requires generating a path!
    2b) Seach Area
      2bi)    Drunken walk
      2bii)   Path to nearest unseen tile
      2biii)  Pinball (pick random direction, walk until we hit a wall, repeat)
    2c) Investigate sound
      2ci)    Path towards sound
    2d) Get/Eat item
      2di)    Pick up / start eating if we're on top
      2dii)   Ranged pick up?
      2diii)  Path to item

To this end, each entity has:
  A position (Tripoint)
  An AI type
    Area awareness (the border size of our pathfinding map - see bottom of file)
    Field awareness (do we path around fire etc)
    Priorities for:
      Attack Enemies  - defined as aggressors
      Attack Neutrals - defined as all entities (e.g. the player)
      Flee
      Eat corpses
      Collect items
      Reach/hold position - for NPCs?
  A current goal
    Both a point (Tripoint) and an entity?
  An attention span
    Turns until we stop pathing towards our current goal
    Starts at some defined number and is reset each time we get a goal update
      Goal updates include seeing an entity to attack, seeing an item to reach,
      hearing a sound


Area awareness - a "border" around the square formed by us and our target
Examples: @ = monster, ^ = target, . = floor, # = wall
  Awareness = 0:  Can't reach target!
  @..#.
  ##.#.
  ^####
  .....

  Awareness = 1:  Can reach target in 12 steps
  .......
  .@..##.
  ###.#.#
  #^####.
  .......
  #.#####

  Awareness = 2:  Can reach target in 5 steps
  #########

  ..@..##..

Worldmap Generation:
  -Covert lakes to ocean when they're ocean-adjacent
  -Draw in city details!
  -Roads between cities

Graphics:
  -SDL integration with cuss stuff
  -Tiles, what do they look like

Data (general):
  -All data types (anything that goes into a Data_pool) needs a error_check()
   function.  Several types contain a string that's supposed to point to data.
   For instance, Terrain holds a string that's the name of the terrain it turns
   into when destroyed/opened/closed/etc.  Fields may hold a string that's the
   name of a field it produces when it consumes fuel.  Most of the time, we can
   check the validity of a data file as we read it, but in these cases, we're
   referencing data that may not have been loaded yet, so we need to check it
   after everything's been loaded.
   The function should be crafted specifically for each class that needs it, and
   should check anything that needs verification and throw a debugmsg if it's an
   issue.  The function should return true if everything's OK, false otherwise.
   Most functions will just be error_check() { return true; }
  -The function could also replace the string with a pointer to the data, since
   string lookup is a slow function, especially compared to a pointer deref.

Monsters:
  -Add natural armor to Monster_type

AI and Pathing:
  -Add a Pathing_feature, "cover" - prefer to path through tiles which are
   opaque!

Status effects:
  Stuff like "Stunned" "Blinded" "Poisoned" etc. 
  Need to add this to:
    -Melee attacks
    -Ranged attacks
    -Fields

Fields:
  Add a flag that indicates that this field likes to rise; meaning, that unless
  there's a roof over it, it will dissipate rapidly.

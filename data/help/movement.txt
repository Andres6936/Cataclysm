Movement can be achieved using <c=white>vikeys<c=/> or the <c=white>numpad<c=/>.  You can also use the arrow keys, but this limits you greatly by preventing diagonal movement.  These charts show how to move:

    <c=white>Vikeys<c=/>              <c=white>Numpad<c=/>

    y k u               7 8 9
     \|/                 \|/
    h-.-l               4-5-6
     /|\                 /|\
    b j n               1 2 3

So, to move north-west, you can press <c=magenta>y<c=/> or <c=magenta>7<c=/>; to pause, you can press <c=magenta>.<c=/> or <c=magenta>5<c=/>.  These keys are totally customizable; for information on how to customize your keybindings, please see the help on <c=cyan>Configuration<c=/>.
While the vikeys may not make a lot of sense at first glance, they make a <c=white>lot<c=/> of sense to your fingers!  Using vikeys keeps your right hand on the home row, close to a lot of other key commands, and movement is very easy once you get used to it.  I highly recommend giving vikeys a chance!

Every time you take a step, you use up a number of <c=ltgreen>Action Points<c=/>, or <c=ltgreen>AP<c=/>.  Moving on flat terrain typically costs 100 AP; moving over counters, through window frames, or on other rough terrain will take more.  Some traits, like <c=ltblue>Fleet-Footed<c=/>, make movement use less AP; some armor may increase or decrease the amount of AP used on movement; and some status effects alter AP used as well.  You can press <c=magenta>@<c=/> to view your character and check the amount of AP you'll use, along with how many AP you regenerate each turn (typically 100, but this is also modified by many factors).

If you want to attempt to hit an enemy with your weapon, simply move into the monster.  For more information about this, see the <c=cyan>Combat<c=/> section of this Help screen.

While exploring the world, you may encounter doors, represented by the <c=brown>+<c=/> symbol.  To open these, you can simply move into them, or you can use the <c=magenta>o<c=/> key.  Some doors are locked, and can only be opened from one side!  After opening a door, you can close it using the <c=magenta>C<c=/> key.  Closing doors behind you will make it harder for most monsters to follow you!

When encountering locked doors, windows, or other obstacles, you can attempt to <c=ltgreen>smash<c=/> through them by using the <c=magenta>s<c=/> key, then selecting a direction.  Smashing down obstacles is much easier with a strong character or an appropriate weapon (some obstacles respond well to blunt weapons, others are better attacked with a cutting tool).

There may be times when you're tempted to hold down a movement key, in order to move faster (in real-time, not game-time).  This can be dangerous - a monster might appear and hit you several times before you can react and take your finger off the key!  To prevent this, you can press <c=magenta>!<c=/> to toggle <c=ltgreen>Safety Mode.<c=/>  While Safety Mode is on, any movement will be ignored if new monsters enter the player's view.  To reset Safety Mode, ignoring the monsters currently in-view, just press <c=magenta>'<c=/>.

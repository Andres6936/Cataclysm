Cataclysm 2 is a game set on our Earth, near the end of the 21st Century.  About 50 years ago, a massive apocalyptic event tore the world apart.  Strange spatial anomalies caused wanton destruction, unearthly monsters began appearing all over, and perhaps worst of all, anyone who died after this event promptly returned to life as a zombie.  These are the events of <c=green>Cataclysm 1<c=/>.

You were born after the apocalypse, and have never known anything more than the shadows of civilization.  You lived out the first part of your life in a coastal farming and fishing town, mostly safe and happy.  But one day, disaster struck.  The perimeter defenses of your town were breached, and a horde of monsters started tearing the town apart.  You collected a few possessions and raced to the docks, setting sail on a boat, the ocean the last safe route out of town.

You quickly collapsed due to exhaustion, and when you awoke, you were adrift at sea, no land in sight.  GPS technology failed long before your time, and without a skilled navigator you were hopelessly lost at sea.  You carefully rationed your supplies and managed to survive for several days before a storm struck, tearing your ship apart and casting you overboard.

Just when you were certain that your time was finally up, you awoke to find yourself on a beach, the wreckage of your ship - and some of your supplies - scattered around you.  This is where <c=ltgreen>Cataclysm 2<c=/> begins.

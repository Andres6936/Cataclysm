<c=ltblue>Configuration<c=/>

Currently, there is only one user-configurable file.  <c=green>keybindings.txt<c=/>, found in the <c=green>data directory<c=/>, contains a list of keys, followed by the command they're bound to.  The format for each line is:
<c=ltblue><list of keys><c=/>  <c=white>=<c=/>  <c=green><command name><c=/>

The list of keys can contain spaces; these are ignored.  The exception is for <c=white>special keys<c=/>, which must be surrounded by spaces.  The special keys available for binding are:
<c=white>Key             Name in keybindings.txt<c=/>
Arrow keys      UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT
Escape          ESC

<c=ltblue>Modding<c=/>

Cataclysm 2 is extensively moddable.  Almost everything in the game is defined by plain-text data files, giving anyone the ability to add or edit items, monsters, terrain, and even map definitions.
There is a <c=ltred>Developer's Wiki<c=/> available at <c=cyan>http://cata2dev.wikia.com/<c=/>.  This wiki explains in detail the layout of each data file.  Please see the wiki for more in-depth instructions on how to edit these.
For help, you can join <c=red>#cataclysm2<c=/> on <c=red>irc.freenode.net<c=/>

The data files are:

Contains definitions for <c=ltgreen>fields<c=/>, which are active effects on the map, such as fire, smoke, acid, etc.

<c=brown>furniture.dat<c=/>

<c=ltblue>Map Layouts<c=/>
All maps in Cataclysm 2 are generated from a data file.  These data files are found in <c=ltblue>data/mapgen<c=/>.  Instructions for writing a map layout can be found at <c=cyan>http://cata2dev.wikia.com/wiki/Map_layouts<c=/>.

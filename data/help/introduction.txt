Welcome to <c=green>Cataclysm 2<c=/>!  Cataclysm 2 is an open-world, post-apocalyptic roguelike survival game.

Cataclysm 2 has a lot in common with "traditional" roguelikes - death is permanent, so once you die, there's no coming back.  The game is turn-based, and there's no time limit, so spend as much time as you need looking through your inventory.  It's also grid-based, and moving diagonally takes as long as moving laterally.

However, Cataclysm 2 is also different from most roguelikes in many ways.  Rather than exploring an underground dungeon, with a limited area on each discrete level, you are exploring a huge surface world which extends to the North, South, East and West.  You can also move vertically - some buildings have many levels to them, and other areas descend into the earth.  However, these vertical levels are not <c=white>discrete<c=/>, in that you can look out of a 2nd story window and see the terrain on the ground below.  You can also shoot out of that window at enemies, and they can return fire (or try to find a way to come up stairs and find you).

As in most roguelikes, Cataclysm 2 requires you to eat periodically.  You also need to keep yourself hydrated and sleep each night, or face diminishing abilities.

Cataclysm 2 has more challenges than many roguelikes, but the near-future setting makes some tasks easier.  firearms, medications, and a wide variety of tools are all available to help you survive.
